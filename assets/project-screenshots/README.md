# Project Screenshots Guide

This folder is for storing custom screenshots of your GitHub projects that will be displayed on your portfolio website.

## How to Add Custom Screenshots

1. **Create a screenshot of your project**
   - Take a screenshot of your project's UI, dashboard, or a key visualization
   - Make sure the image is clear and represents your project well
   - Recommended dimensions: 1200 x 630 pixels (16:9 ratio)
   - Save the image in JPG format

2. **Name your screenshot file correctly**
   - The filename must match your GitHub repository name (converted to lowercase with special characters replaced by hyphens)
   - For example:
     - Repository name: "Data-Analytics-Dashboard" → filename: "data-analytics-dashboard.jpg"
     - Repository name: "Portfolio_Website" → filename: "portfolio-website.jpg"

3. **Place the file in this folder**
   - Save your screenshot image in this `project-screenshots` folder

4. **Refresh your portfolio**
   - Your custom screenshot will automatically appear on your portfolio website
   - If the screenshot doesn't appear, make sure the filename exactly matches your repository name (with the conversion rules above)

## Example

If you have a GitHub repository named "COVID-19-Data-Analysis", save your screenshot as:
```
covid-19-data-analysis.jpg
```

And place it in this folder.

## Default Behavior

If no custom screenshot is found for a repository, the website will display a themed icon based on the repository's content (data analytics, web development, etc.).
